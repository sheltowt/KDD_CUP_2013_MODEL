KDD_CUP_2013_MODEL
==================

I jumped into building a model for the KDD 2013 cup with 48 hours to go.  My strategy was to prototype an ensemble of models on my laptop, and experiment with modifying a variety of parameters, before booting up an EC2 instance and training a model overnight.

I was able to set up the PostgreSQL database, and run the bechmark code provided by Kaggle which was a RandomForest Classifier.  However, upon trying to submit my entry I was informed that the competitions was closed for submitting new entries.  Bummer!
